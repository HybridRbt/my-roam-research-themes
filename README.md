# My Roam Research themes
A personal collection of two Roam Research themes that I am currently using on a daily basis.  

## Bear Red Graphite
This one is adapted from [here](https://github.com/ahonn/roam-research-themes). The original is already excellent, the only change I made is:
	1. Increase the main font size and add a font family
	2. Wrap all content in a media wrapper so it can be automatically turn on/off with the system light/dark mode
	3. Tweak the block reference button to make it a little bit more obvious
