# My Roam Research themes
A personal collection of two Roam Research themes that I am currently using on a daily basis.  

## Bear Red Graphite
This one is adapted from [here](https://github.com/ahonn/roam-research-themes). The original is already excellent, the only change I made is:
	1. Increase the main font size and add a font family
	2. Wrap all content in a media wrapper so it can be automatically turn on/off with the system light/dark mode
	3. Tweak the block reference count button to make it a little bit more obvious

## Bear Panic
Another personal favorite. The original is included [here](https://github.com/adityadaniel/roam-dark-theme). I really love it, and it already has the ability to turn on/off with the system. But there’s two problems that’s preventing it from being my daily driver:
	1. There’s no customization for highlighting, so the characters that are highlighted remains white. White characters on a yellow background is really not optimum for my eyes. I searched through Github and found an elegant solution in [here](https://github.com/sjsanc/roam_darktheme), and merged it in.
	2. The block reference count button by default is in dark color, and when the main background turns dark, it’s invisible. Tried the same tweak above but it cannot change the color. After scratching off 32.4% of my hair I found the place to adjust that in [here](https://github.com/devonzuegel/digital-nesting/blob/master/roam.css)

Now I am in heaven.
